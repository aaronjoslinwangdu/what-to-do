# WhatToDo

WhatToDo is a simple, JIRA inspired, todo tracker. 

This was mainly a fun project for me to learn more about authentication/persistent login using JSON Web Tokens and React as well as RTK Query. 

## Installation & Usage

Clone the repository, run `npm install` in `client` and root directories. You will have to set environment variables in the root directory for `MONGO_URI=mymongodbclusteruri`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=mysupersecretaccesstokenstring`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=mysupersecretrefreshtokenstring`.
